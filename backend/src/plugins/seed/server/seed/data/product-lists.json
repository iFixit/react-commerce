      "legacyDescription": "Ten years after the launch of the original iPhone, Apple’s latest refresh of the product line skips the ‘iPhone 7s’ name in favor of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 plus. The iPhone 8 (as well as the 8 Plus and the X) was formally announced on September 12, 2017. The design has remained fairly similar to its predecessor, with the only distinguishing difference being the switch from an aluminum backing to a glass back case. Apple has refined this design over the last three years, so it’s highly polished. The iPhone 8 has added fast-charging support, so you can charge up to 50 percent of the battery in 30 minutes. There’s also wireless charging support through the Qi standard, made possible by the new glass back. Internally, the phone possesses a new hexa-core system-on-chip with two high-performance cores and four high-efficiency cores along with an Apple designed GPU that all work to improve system and graphics performance.\n\nThere are three models of the iPhone 8. [Model A1863](https://www.ifixit.com/Store/iPhone/iPhone-8-A1863) is available for carriers Verizon and Sprint in the U.S. and for carriers in China, Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand.

[Model A1906](https://www.ifixit.com/Store/iPhone/iPhone-8-A1906) is for carriers in Japan.\n\nThe most commonly needed repairs for the iPhone 8 are cracked screens and dead battery replacements. iFixit carries the best [iPhone 8 screens](https://pnoble.cominor.com/Store/iPhone/iPhone-8-LCD-and-Digitizer/IF371-000) and [iPhone 8 batteries](https://pnoble.cominor.com/Store/iPhone/iPhone-8-Battery/IF371-001) on the market.\n\nAll iPhone 8 repairs will require a [Pentalobe P2 screwdriver](https://pnoble.cominor.com/Store/Tools/P2-Pentalobe-Screwdriver-iPhone/IF145-096) in addition to standard precision electronics tools. Any repair that removes the battery from the chassis will require battery replacement strips. If the LCD display is removed from the front of the phone for any repair, you will need replacement display adhesive to restore water resistant functionality. All iFixit Fix Kits come with all tools and replacement adhesive needed to complete the repair.\n\nOnce all parts and tools have been acquired, check out iFixit’s [iPhone 8 repair guides](https://pnoble.cominor.com/Device/iPhone_8) for step-by-step instructions on how to make the fix.\n\nThe iPhone 8 earned a 6 out of 10 in iFixit’s repairability assessment.

However internally, the iPhone 8 Plus boasts a six core A11 bionic processor which is the same as its smaller siblings, but impressive nonetheless. The main performance boost with this generation of iPhone is the battery life and RAM storage. The RAM has been upgraded by a whole gigabyte of memory to help with multitasking, and the battery life can last a solid 32 hours between charges on average. With this level of stamina, the iPhone 8 Plus has few rivals. The cameras on the back are improved 12 megapixel camera, which both have physically larger sensors than last year’s iPhone 7 Plus on which the dual-camera system was introduced. The two cameras work together one has a standard wide-angle f/1.8 lens and the other has a slower f/2.8 lens with an effective two times magnification compared to the standard lens.\n\nThe most commonly needed repairs for the iPhone 8 Plus are cracked screens and dead battery replacements. iFixit has the best [iPhone 8 Plus screens](https://pnoble.cominor.com/Store/iPhone/iPhone-8-Plus-LCD-and-Digitizer/IF372-000) and [iPhone 8 Plus batteries](https://pnoble.cominor.com/Store/iPhone/iPhone-8-Plus-Battery/IF372-001) on the market.\n\nAll iPhone 8 Plus repairs will require a [Pentalobe P2 screwdriver](https://pnoble.cominor.com/Store/Tools/P2-Pentalobe-Screwdriver-iPhone/IF145-096) in addition to standard precision electronics tools.

The Xbox 360 E was immediately available to consumers and would continue to be sold alongside the Xbox One as Microsoft's economy console.\n\nThe 360 E is easy to distinguish from previous Xbox 360 consoles because it abandons the tapered design of earlier consoles for a more rectangular form factor. In addition, the rear of the Xbox 360 E has only two USB ports, HDMI or 1/8th inch A/V output for audio and video(component or composite), and a sticker with the model number on it. The power plug has also changed to a circular plug.",
