         #           https://infrequently.org/2021/03/the-performance-inequality-gap/
         #
         # - red-status-percentage: sets the percent size increase where you get a red
         #                          status indicator, defaults to 20%
         #
         # Either of these arguments can be changed or removed by editing the `nextBundleAnalysis`
